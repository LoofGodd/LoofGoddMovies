# Movies React App

I created this website to be a proof to get a job quickly. I should continue adding more features and de-some-bugs but I don't know if I'm right, I just want to spend time learning NEXTJS instead. 

## Tools
Development: Vite
Library: React + Typescript
dependencies: Axios, React Query, React Router, Tailwind, Zustand


I don't know if I will maintain this website. Anyway Good bye!
